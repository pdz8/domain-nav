# Domain Navigate

Domain Navigate is a Firefox extension that enables quicker back/forth navigation through session history.
Instead of going just one page back, the Domain Navigate back button skips all the way back to the previous domain's last visited page (and similarly for forward).

### How is this useful?

Imagine you had just spent the last 3 hours binge-reading xkcd comics.
Now you want to go back to the Reddit post that kicked off your xkcd marathon and continue where you left off on Reddit.
However there are now 3 hours worth of comics in your session history blocking you from getting back to Reddit.
You would have to hit the normal back button a thousand times (or use the dropdown a hundred times) to return to the post.
With Domain Navigate's back button, one click is all that's needed.

    It was used as reference for the hairy parts of Firefox's Add-On libraries.
